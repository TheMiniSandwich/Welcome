# Welcome
Contains info on Private Repositories

While I would like to display my coding projects from class that demonstrate my abilities in Python, C, Verilog, Assembly, and MATLAB, it is against Purdue's academic dishonesty policy as the projects may be viewable by students currently taking the course. If you would like to view these files, please reach out to me on either my school email or personal email with the subject "Request to access GitHub Repositories" as well as who you are affiliated with and I will provide an access key to the repositories you wish to view.
